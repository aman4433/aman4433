# Aman Shrivastava

> Cloud Engineer · Open Source Contributor · Curious Builder

I work with systems that scale, pipelines that heal, and teams that ship fast and reliably.  
Currently working with [IBM](https://www.ibm.com), where I focus on infrastructure automation, OpenShift, and hybrid cloud ecosystems.

I'm driven by curiosity, community, and clean YAML.
